# Texas Grid Analytics - Senior Design Project
[Texas Grid Analytics](http://grid-analytics.ece.utexas.edu/) is a web-based dashboard for for displaying grid and market conditions. 

## About Texas Grid Analytics
The electricity infrastructure and market in Texas are managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). It schedules the power production of over 710 generation units having a total capacity of over 86 GW and moves electric power over 46,500 miles of 69 kV and higher transmission lines. As the nationâ€™s largest wind power producer, ERCOT operates a total installed capacity of 25 GW wind generation capacity. Additionally, ERCOT runs the electricity wholesale bulk-power and retail markets. Over 1800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell, or use wholesale electricity. To operate the Texas grid reliably, ERCOT monitors and collects grid and market conditions. Collected data are diverse and voluminous.

Texas Grid Analytics is a web-based dashboard for for displaying grid and market conditions. In the future, we aim to have analytics functions as well.
